# Infrastructure as Code with Terraform

This repository follows best practices for organizing Terraform project, promoting modularity, reusability, and maintainability. Each environment is separated, allowing for independent management and configuration, while reusable modules encapsulate infrastructure components and promote consistency across environments.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the provisioning of a scalable and resilient infrastructure on cloud platforms using Terraform. It follows best practices to ensure maintainability, scalability, and security of the infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Terraform Modules**: Organized infrastructure code into reusable modules for better maintainability and scalability.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: All infrastructure resources are defined as code using Terraform, allowing for version control, collaboration, and reproducibility.
- **Cloud Provider Agnostic**: Designed to work seamlessly across different cloud providers such as AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure.
- **Environment Management**: Configured to support multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production) with parameterized configurations.
- **Security Best Practices**: Implements security best practices, including IAM roles and policies, network security rules, and encryption.
- **Scalability and High Availability**: Architecture designed for scalability and high availability, utilizing auto-scaling groups, load balancers, and fault-tolerant configurations.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/IaC_with_Terraform.git`
2. **Install Terraform**: Ensure Terraform is installed on your local machine. Refer to the [Terraform documentation](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) for installation instructions.
3. **Set Up Credentials**: Configure credentials for your cloud provider(s) according to the Terraform documentation.
4. **Review Configuration**: Review the Terraform configuration files (`*.tf`) to understand the infrastructure resources and configurations.
5. **Initialize Terraform**: Run `terraform init` to initialize the project and download necessary providers and modules.
6. **Plan Infrastructure**: Run `terraform plan` to review the execution plan and ensure it matches your expectations.
7. **Apply Changes**: Run `terraform apply` to create or update the infrastructure based on the Terraform configuration.
8. **Test Infrastructure**: Test the provisioned infrastructure to ensure it meets the desired requirements and functionality.
9. **Destroy Infrastructure (Optional)**: After testing, run `terraform destroy` to tear down the infrastructure and avoid incurring unnecessary costs.
